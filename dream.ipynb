Riding a rhino through the sunset above the clouds suggests a feeling of freedom and transcendence, as if you were rising above your everyday concerns and experiencing a sense of empowerment.\\n\\nThe urgency to reach the bathroom reflects a need for release and relief, which could be related to a situation or emotions that you are trying to let go of in your waking life. This sense of urgency may also indicate a fear of losing control or not being able to handle certain situations adequately.\\n\\nThe unexpected sight of your mom kissing your sister could represent a feeling of betrayal or a sense of boundaries being crossed within your family dynamic. It may reflect a perception of some sort of conflict or tension between your family members, or even a fear of secrets being revealed.\\n\\nThe act of shitting yourself in the dream can be seen as a symbol of embarrassment, vulnerability, or feeling exposed. It may suggest that you are afraid of being judged or criticized by others, or that you fear losing control over a situation or aspect of your life.\\n\\nOverall, this dream seems to reflect a mix of feelings related to freedom, empowerment, urgency, anxiety, betrayal, and vulnerability.

When Arachne's skills surpassed even Athena's, the goddess transformed her into a spider as punishment, forever weaving her intricate webs.\\n\\nThe spiders in your dream could represent the web of fate or the intricate threads that weave your life's path.

The webs they have built could symbolize the entanglements or obstacles you feel unable to escape or overcome.\\n\\nYour attempt to spray the spiders with water, yet having no effect, suggests that you may be trying to wash away or eliminate these difficulties but feeling powerless to do so. This could reflect a sense of frustration or helplessness in your waking life when faced with certain obstacles or challenges.\\n\\nIt may be beneficial for you to explore the underlying emotions and circumstances surrounding this dream.
